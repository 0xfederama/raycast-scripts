# My Raycast Scripts

These are the scripts that I use in [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). I personally made all of them, besides the color 
one made by [Jesse](https://github.com/jesse-c).

Scripts list:
- `color`: sample a color from anywhere on the screen
- `isitup`: check if a website is up or down (needs `python3` installed)
- `open-link`: open a website, not just a google search
- `timer`: set a timer for the specified amount of minutes
